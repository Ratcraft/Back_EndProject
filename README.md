# Back_EndProject by TomorrowC18

Hi, welcome to the BackEnd Project for Dorset College by the TomorrowC18 group.

In order to build the project, you need to go to :

    - source/BackEndProject/
    - go in the terminal and write : "dotnet watch run"

The project should launch right after that.

Thanks for seeing our project.

The TommorowC18 team.
